# Story Maker
## Web toy for making, sharing and finding simple interactive stories

The idea is to have a tool that lets you draw your own ugly-ass Choose Your Own Adventure comic, upload it, and share it with your disappointed friends who just want you to do something productive with your life. Ideally you'll also be able to browse other people's comics and ask yourself if this is really where technology has taken us.
